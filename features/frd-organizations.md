# Feature Requirements Document: Organizations

## Introduction/Overview

The Organizations feature enables users to collaborate on shared resources and projects within StatusZen. This addresses the problem of users needing to work together on shared data and resources rather than operating in isolation. Each user will belong to at least one organization, with clear ownership and membership management capabilities.

## Goals

1. Enable collaborative access to shared resources and data within organizations
2. Provide clear ownership and role-based access control for organizations
3. Streamline team management through invitation and membership systems
4. Ensure seamless user experience with automatic personal organization creation
5. Maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access between organizations

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to automatically have a personal organization created so that I can start using the application immediately without additional setup.

2. **As an organization owner**, I want to invite team members via email so that they can access our shared resources and collaborate effectively.

3. **As an organization owner**, I want to manage existing members (view, remove) so that I can maintain proper access control as team composition changes.

4. **As an organization owner**, I want to transfer ownership to another member so that organizational continuity is maintained when I step down or leave.

5. **As an organization member**, I want to see which organization I'm currently working in so that I understand the context of my data and actions.

6. **As an invited user**, I want to receive an email invitation and easily accept it so that I can join the organization without friction.

7. **As a user**, I want to be warned before critical actions (like organization deletion) so that I don't accidentally lose important data or access.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Organization Management
1. The system must automatically create a personal organization for every new user upon their first login after signup.
2. The system must allow organization owners to create additional organizations.
3. The system must allow organization owners to update organization details (name, description).
4. The system must allow organization owners to delete organizations with proper warnings about member removal.
5. The system must prevent organization deletion if it would leave any user without an organization.

### Membership Management
6. The system must allow organization owners to invite new members via email address.
7. The system must require admin approval for all new member invitations.
8. The system must allow organization owners to view all current members and their roles.
9. The system must allow organization owners to remove members from the organization.
10. The system must automatically create a personal organization for users who are removed from their last organization.

### Ownership Management
11. The system must allow ownership transfer only from current owner to existing members.
12. The system must support multiple owners per organization.
13. The system must require confirmation from the new owner before completing ownership transfer.
14. The system must ensure at least one owner remains in each organization at all times.

### Data Access Control
15. The system must make all existing user data organization-scoped by default.
16. The system must implement proper access controls so users can only see data from their current organization.
17. The system must prevent data transfer between organizations.
18. The system must maintain data integrity when users switch between organizations.

### User Interface
19. The system must provide separate pages for different management areas (members, settings, invitations).
20. The system must display the current organization context clearly to users.
21. The system must provide an organization management interface at `/account/organization`.
22. The system must integrate organization selection into the main application navigation.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-level organization hierarchies** - Only flat owner/member structure will be supported initially.
2. **Custom role definitions** - Only owner and member roles will be available.
3. **Department or team structures** within organizations.
4. **Data migration between organizations** - Users cannot move data between organizations.
5. **Public organizations** - All organizations require invitation to join.
6. **Organization billing management** - Billing remains at the user level initially.
7. **Organization-level analytics or reporting**.

## Design Considerations

### Database Schema
- `organizations` table with id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
- `organization_members` table with organization_id, user_id, role, joined_at
- `organization_invitations` table with organization_id, email, invited_by, status, created_at, expires_at
- Update existing user data tables to include organization_id foreign keys

### User Experience
- Use Nuxt UI Pro components for consistent styling with existing application
- Follow the established dark theme and design patterns from the current auth pages
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Provide clear feedback for all actions with toast notifications

### Access Control
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase for organization-scoped data access
- Use server-side validation for all organization management operations
- Ensure proper authentication checks for all organization-related API endpoints

## Technical Considerations

### Integration with Existing Systems
- Build upon the existing Supabase authentication system
- Extend the current user profile management patterns
- Use the established server API endpoint structure (`server/api/`)
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and composable architecture

### Performance Considerations
- Implement efficient queries for organization member lookups
- Use appropriate database indexes for organization-scoped data access
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed organization data

### Security Requirements
- All organization management operations must be server-side validated
- Email invitations must include proper token-based verification
- Implement rate limiting for invitation sending
- Ensure proper authorization checks for all organization operations

## Success Metrics

Success will be measured by:
- Successful auto-creation of personal organizations for all new users
- Zero data leakage between organizations (verified through security testing)
- Smooth invitation and onboarding flow (measured by completion rates)
- Proper handling of all edge cases (ownership transfers, deletions, etc.)
- Integration testing with existing user profile and authentication systems

## Open Questions

1. **Email Templates**: What should the invitation email template look like? Should it match the existing auth email styling?

2. **Organization Limits**: Should there be limits on the number of organizations a user can own or belong to?

3. **Invitation Expiration**: How long should organization invitations remain valid before expiring?

4. **Organization Naming**: Should organization names be unique globally or only within a user's scope?

5. **Default Organization**: When a user belongs to multiple organizations, how should the system determine which is the "active" organization?

6. **Migration Strategy**: How should existing user data be migrated to be organization-scoped for current users?
