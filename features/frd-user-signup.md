# Feature Requirements Document: User Signup Flow

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a dedicated user signup flow for developers and technical users joining the StatusZen application. The current login page toggle approach doesn't provide adequate space for collecting necessary user information or delivering a proper onboarding experience. This signup flow will integrate with Supabase authentication, collect essential user details, and support future plan selection capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Improve User Onboarding**: Create a dedicated signup experience that better guides new technical users
2. **Collect Essential Information**: Gather email, password, name, and company/organization details during registration
3. **Enable Email Verification**: Implement Supabase email verification with custom branded templates
4. **Support Future Monetization**: Design signup flow to accommodate plan selection (free now, paid plans later)
5. **Reduce Signup Friction**: Allow limited app access during email verification process with clear verification prompts

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to sign up with my professional details so that I can access StatusZen with a properly configured account
2. **As a new user**, I want to start using the app immediately after signup so that I can evaluate its value while my email verification is pending
3. **As a team lead**, I want to specify my company/organization during signup so that future team features can be properly configured
4. **As a user**, I want to receive a professional, branded email verification so that I trust the authenticity of the service
5. **As a potential customer**, I want to see plan options during signup so that I can choose the right tier for my needs (future state)

## Functional Requirements

1. **Signup Form**: The system must provide a dedicated signup page with fields for email, password, full name, and company/organization
2. **Password Validation**: The system must enforce strong password requirements (minimum 8 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols)
3. **Email Uniqueness**: The system must prevent signup with email addresses that already exist in the system
4. **Supabase Integration**: The system must create user accounts through Supabase Auth API
5. **Custom Email Templates**: The system must send branded email verification using custom Supabase email templates
6. **Limited Access**: The system must allow users to access the main dashboard after signup but display a verification banner until email is confirmed
7. **Plan Selection UI**: The system must include a plan selection component that shows "Free" as the only option initially, designed to accommodate paid plans later
8. **Verification Banner**: The system must show a dismissible but persistent banner prompting email verification for unverified users
9. **Form Validation**: The system must provide real-time validation feedback for all form fields
10. **Error Handling**: The system must handle and display appropriate error messages for various failure scenarios
11. **Responsive Design**: The signup form must work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices using Nuxt UI Pro components
12. **Navigation**: The system must provide clear navigation between signup and existing login pages

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Social media authentication (GitHub OAuth will remain on login page only)
- Multi-step signup wizard (single page form preferred)
- Account deletion during signup process
- SMS verification options
- CAPTCHA integration (unless spam becomes an issue)
- Admin approval workflows
- Bulk user import capabilities

## Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: Use existing Nuxt UI Pro components (UPageCard, UForm, UButton, etc.) to maintain design consistency
- **Form Layout**: Single-column layout with clear field grouping (Personal Info, Company Info, Account Security, Plan Selection)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Plan selection should be visually prominent but not overwhelming for free tier
- **Brand Consistency**: Email templates should match app branding and include StatusZen logo
- **Verification Banner**: Use UAlert component with dismissible option and appropriate styling
- **Error States**: Leverage Nuxt UI's built-in error styling and toast notifications

## Technical Considerations

- **Supabase Auth**: Integrate with existing `useSupabaseClient()` and `useSupabaseUser()` composables
- **Email Templates**: Configure custom Supabase email templates in Supabase dashboard
- **Form Validation**: Use Vue 3 reactivity and Nuxt UI's validation patterns
- **State Management**: Utilize Nuxt's built-in state management for signup flow
- **Type Safety**: Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for signup data
- **Database Schema**: Ensure user profiles table accommodates name and company fields
- **Security**: Implement proper CSRF protection and rate limiting considerations
- **SEO**: Ensure signup page has appropriate meta tags and is accessible

## Success Metrics

- **Signup Completion Rate**: Measure percentage of users who complete the signup form vs. those who start it
- **Email Verification Rate**: Track percentage of users who verify their email within 24/48 hours
- **Post-Signup Engagement**: Measure how many verified users actively use the app within first week
- **Form Abandonment**: Identify which fields cause users to abandon the signup process
- **Error Reduction**: Reduce signup-related support tickets compared to current login-toggle approach
- **Technical Performance**: Maintain <2 second signup form load time and <1 second form submission response

## Open Questions

1. **Database Schema**: Do we need to create a user_profiles table or extend existing Supabase user metadata?
2. **Email Verification Timeout**: What should be the expiration time for email verification links?
3. **Plan Selection Future State**: Should we implement the plan selection UI now (disabled) or add it later when paid plans launch?
4. **Company Field**: Should company/organization be required or optional?
5. **Verification Reminder**: Should we send reminder emails for unverified accounts after X days?
6. **Analytics**: What specific tracking events should we implement for the signup funnel?
7. **Rate Limiting**: What signup attempt limits should we implement to prevent abuse?
8. **Custom Validation**: Are there any company-specific validation rules needed (e.g., email domain restrictions)?
